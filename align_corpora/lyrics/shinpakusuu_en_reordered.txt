My heart – when it stops, I’m sure that this world – I think I’ll have fully enjoyed it
At your side, I think I just want to keep smiling
As for what I’ll leave behind, pretty much nothing;

Through the pounding in my chest, I still want to protect you
As a reason to live, that’s fine by me
One more, one more – I count the same tears,

My throbbing pulse conveys them, The recurring sounds and my running thoughts
Let us promise to be apart no longer, so that you should never be lonely

My heart – in one minute,
Seventy times, it shouts “I live” 
But when I’m with you, it runs fast, And one hundred ten times, it shouts 
“I love”

Through the pounding in my chest, I still want to protect you
As a reason to live, that’s fine by me
Once more, once more – the same heart repeats,
And once again, we know each other

If there had to be some reason for them,
The meetings between you and I:
While I don’t know if it would be fate,
Their sheer happiness is unchanging

Until that someday when I’m ended,
How many more “loves” can I utter?
To your being here with me, I offer gratitude,
And for simply being alive, I thank you.

My throbbing pulse conveys them,
The recurring sounds and my running thoughts
Until our heartbeats should stop.
Let us promise to keep loving each other.
